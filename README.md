# liveasy_app

A new Flutter project.

*note*

1. I did not put the entire image on the first screen below the page as I could do it (by grouping both the vector image in Figma, downloading and then applying in the project) but just didn't see it as an important aspect.

2. I used elevated button and dialog box and not the drop down button to generate the language (localization) in the first screen.

3. After entering your phone number, please do wait for a while, It'll redirect you to a ReCaptcha page (mandatory security concerns) and then generate u the OTP. And then It'll take u to the next screen.

4. In the Profile screen I have used Secondary to place the icon after the texts in the Radio list button.
